### About Me ###

Since September 2024, I have been a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Information Security at Royal Holloway, University of London. Before joining Royal Holloway, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at George Mason University from April to August 2024, hosted by [Giuseppe Ateniese](https://ateniese.github.io). From September 2021 to February 2024,  I held a Postdoctoral position at Aarhus University ([Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup/)) hosted by [Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/). I earned my Ph.D. in September 2021 from Stevens Institute of Technology, where I conducted my research under the guidance of  [Giuseppe Ateniese](https://ateniese.github.io).



### Research Interests ###
My research interests are theoretical and applied cryptography with a focus on advanced public-key primitives and their applications.
I am also interested in blockchain and privacy-preserving machine learning.

### Grants ###

Protocol Labs, RFP-009 on Proofs of Space and Useful Space, Principal Investigator.
